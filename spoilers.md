# MetalBallBitBurner

This document is a work in progress.

## Spoilers

## My Playstyle
I focused on new mechanics and mixed in better stats priorities in mid, because I figured I'd stop playing before I'd actually win the game. I tackled the bitnodes as follows: 

	01 General
	02 Gangs
	05 Intelligence
	12 Recursion
	10 Sleeves (6x on first attempt)
	13 Stanek
	08 Free TIX
	09 Hacknet
	07 Bladeburners API
	03 Corporations
	04 Singularity
	06 Bladeburners (beat all of the bitnodes now)
	12 Recursion
	09 Hacknet
	09 Hacknet
	08 Free TIX


I redid 1 (3x), 2, 10 somewhere in there.

08/03/2023 07:47 AM So I'm still missing 11. The Big Crash.

## Rewards

## My review

Bitburner is an idle game for the first day and then a very odd concoction of random mechanics. Most of the bitnodes don't seem to blend very well with others.

BitNode-1: It's fun. I wouldn't change a thing about bn1, except make crimes more viable.

LIKE BitNode-2: Gangs >> Doesn't really match the theme of the game. Lots of micro-management, but feels rewarding.

HATE BitNode-3: Corporations >> I love the idea of managing warehouse space, employees, material and product production, and debating the plethora of ways to proceed. However, I hate this bitnode. I've had to do a ton of micro-management. I chose the wrong things to invest in. I had absolutely zero ways to help my corporation be successful outside of corporations and hacknet. And even with hacknet's help, Bladeburners was just exceptionally faster.

DONT BitNode-4: Singularity >> Nothing really interesting about Singularity. Great for automation, but I don't focus on automation.

LIKE BitNode-5: Intelligence >> Intelligence is an amazing stat. It opens up ways to win in other Bitnodes when the difficulty gets stupid. Having the updated stats page is really helpful too.

BitNode-6: Bladeburners >> N/A

BitNode-7: Bladeburners 2079 >> I read somewhere that this was the better of the two to start with, so I tried it. It felt slow. By then, I've already beaten like 8 bitnodes so I was getting tired of feeling slow. But I beat it.

BitNode-8: Ghost of Wall Street >> By far, the worst and most boring bitnode. Rewards are nice tho.

BitNode-9: Hacknet Server >> 

BitNode-10: Sleeves >> 

BitNode-11: Company Salary >> Haven't played it yet
BitNode-12: The Recursion
BitNode-13: Stanek

	I'm incredibly frustrated on how hard it is to destroy this bitnode, only for it to be nerfed in every other bitnode. Wth! 

	It does raise the question if you want to suffer hard in the beginning and be better in the end. But no one knows how difficult it's going to be in the end, so it's generally a narrow-minded YES for the most part.
	
## How I would improve the game


#### BitNode-1:

It's fun. I wouldn't change a thing about bn1, except make crimes more viable.

Also, they need to slap you in the face with how to access ns.otherLibraries.functions after you beat this node. Geez.

#### BitNode-2: Gangs.


#### BitNode-3: Corporations

The API should be available upfront while playing it AND after beating it the first time. This game is a coding game first and idle game second, so it makes no sense to withhold its functions until its THIRD playthrough.

Closing a division should refund you 90% of its costs.

There should be Corporation augmentations.

#### BitNode-4: Singularity



What if Singularity rewarded you with cores at random servers?

Infiltration should be automated.

What if you could swap bodies/stats/augments with a sleeve?

#### BitNode-5: Intelligence

What if Intelligence rewarded you with more RAM at random servers?

#### BitNode-6: Bladeburners

#### BitNode-7: Bladeburners 2079

Traveling didn't really stand out enough for me to use it. I still don't understand what communities are for.

I didn't bother with prioritizing one skill point over another. Except for Overclock and Hands of Midas.

#### BitNode-8: Ghost of Wall Street

I saw a suggestion on Discord that they have random news events that bring chaos to the market. I like the idea. There was more to the suggestion but it went over my head.

What if there was random prompts to buy stocks at a discount?

#### BitNode-9: Hacknet Server

RAM shouldn't be NaN. In fact, every server in the game should have at least 1 RAM. It just makes sense.

#### BitNode-10: Sleeves

Each sleeve should come with its own terminal. And then singularity might actually be nice. Infiltrations. Manual hacking. More on this later.

Sleeves should be able to participate in gangs.

#### BitNode-11: Company Salary

#### BitNode-12: The Recursion

#### BitNode-13: Stanek

I'm still mad about how much they nerf Stanek in other bitnodes.
