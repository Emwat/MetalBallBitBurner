ZOE is weird.
I have two fragments around this much:

+98% faster hack(), grow(), and weaken()
+220% hacking skill

Sleeve1: Only ZOE
Sleeve3: Everything I can afford
Sleeve5: Everything I can afford except ZOE
It gave my first sleeve 262% hacking level multiplier and 262% hacking experience multiplier.

The moment I upgraded some augments on some other sleeve, Sleeve1 drops to 209%. Wow. Just wow.

Sleeve3 is really weird too. Like... It has been my go-to sleeve to upgrade and
 its upgrades are ridiculously higher than my other sleeves, even I made sleeve 4 copy everything.
